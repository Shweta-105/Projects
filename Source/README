Resume Screening

•	Overview:
The Resume Screening is a Python-based project that connects to a MySQL database, filters resumes based on user-defined skills and education, ranks candidates according to predefined required skills, and exports the results to a CSV file.

•	Features:
- Connects to MySQL database to fetch stored resumes.
- Filters resumes by user-input skills and education.
- Ranks candidates based on the number of matching required skills.
- Exports the filtered & ranked results to a CSV file.
- Handles "No match found" gracefully.

•	Technologies Used:
- Python (Data Processing)
- MySQL (Database)
- CSV Module (Exporting results)

•	Project Structure:
Resume_Screening
-main.py   # Main script for filtering & ranking
- resumes_output.csv    # All resumes (exported)
- filtered_ranked_resumes.csv    # Filtered & ranked resumes
- README     # Project documentation

•	How It Works

1. The script connects to your MySQL database containing resumes.
2. User enters skill and education to search for.
3. Script fetches matching resumes from the database.
4. Candidates are ranked based on required skills (Python, SQL, Data Analysis).
5. Results are exported to filtered_ranked_resumes.csv.




•	Usage:

1. Install Requirements
pip install mysql-connector-python

2. Run the Script
python main.py

3. Enter Filters when prompted:
Enter skill to search: Python
Enter education to search: B.Sc in Computer Science

4. Check Output
- filtered_ranked_resumes.csv will have the ranked candidates.
